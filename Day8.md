# **Day 8 – Azure Pricing, SLAs & Support**

This document covers **cost management and support** topics.

---

# **1. Azure Pricing Concepts**

### **Factors Affecting Cost**

* Compute time
* Storage usage
* Data transfer
* Region

---

# **2. Cost Management Tools**

* **Azure Pricing Calculator** – estimate cost before deployment
* **Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)** – compare on-prem vs Azure
* **Azure Cost Management** – monitor and control spend

---

# **3. Cost Optimization**

* Reserved Instances
* Auto-scaling
* Shutting down unused resources
* Right-sizing VMs

---

# **4. Service Level Agreements (SLAs)**

### **What is SLA?**

Guarantee of uptime expressed as a percentage.

### **Common SLAs**

* 99.9%
* 99.99%

### **Key Rule**

* Using multiple services does NOT combine SLAs

---

# **5. Service Lifecycle**

* Preview → General Availability → Deprecated

---

# **6. Azure Support Plans**

| Plan                | Use Case         |
| ------------------- | ---------------- |
| Basic               | Billing & docs   |
| Developer           | Non-prod         |
| Standard            | Prod workloads   |
| Professional Direct | Mission-critical |

---

# **Exam TL;DR**

* Calculator before deploy
* Cost Management after deploy
* SLA ≠ combined


# **Interview Questions & Answers (Day 8)**

### **Q1: What tools are used to estimate Azure cost before deployment?**

Azure Pricing Calculator and TCO Calculator.

### **Q2: Which tool is used to monitor Azure spending after deployment?**

Azure Cost Management.

### **Q3: What is an SLA?**

A Service Level Agreement defines guaranteed uptime for an Azure service.

### **Q4: Can SLAs be combined across services?**

No, SLAs are not cumulative; each service has its own SLA.

### **Q5: What are Azure support plans?**

Different support tiers (Basic, Developer, Standard, Professional Direct) offering varying response times and services.

### **Q6: What is the Azure service lifecycle?**

Preview → General Availability → Deprecated.
