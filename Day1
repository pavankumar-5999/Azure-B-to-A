# Day 1 – Cloud Basics, Benefits, Shared Responsibility

## 1. What is Cloud Computing?
Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services—including servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence—over the internet ("the cloud").

### **Key Points:**
- Access services on-demand without physical hardware
- No upfront investment (reduces **CAPEX**, increases **OPEX flexibility**)
- **Pay-as-you-go** pricing

### **Example:**
Instead of buying a server, deploy a website on Azure App Service and pay only for the consumed resources.

### **Cloud vs On-Premises:**
| Feature | On-Premises | Cloud |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| Hardware Ownership | You own everything | Provider owns |
| Upfront Cost | High (CAPEX) | Low (OPEX) |
| Scalability | Limited | Elastic/Instant |
| Maintenance | Customer | Provider |

---

## 2. Cloud Service Models

### **A. Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)**
You manage: OS, applications, data  
Provider manages: hardware, network

**Example:** Azure Virtual Machines

**Pros:** Flexible, scalable, full control  
**Cons:** You handle updates & security

---

### **B. Platform as a Service (PaaS)**
You manage: applications & data  
Provider manages: OS, runtime, infrastructure

**Examples:** Azure App Service, Azure SQL Database

**Pros:** Less maintenance, fast deployment  
**Cons:** Less control compared to IaaS

---

### **C. Software as a Service (SaaS)**
Provider manages everything.

**Examples:** Microsoft 365, Teams, Outlook

**Pros:** No infrastructure to manage  
**Cons:** Limited customization

---

### **D. Comparison Table**
| Feature | IaaS | PaaS | SaaS |
|--------|------|------|------|
| Infrastructure | Provided | Provided | Provided |
| OS | Customer | Provider | Provider |
| Applications | Customer | Customer | Provided |
| Maintenance | High | Medium | Low |
| Examples | VMs, Storage | App Service, SQL DB | Office 365 |

---

## 3. Cloud Deployment Models

### **A. Public Cloud**
- Services shared across multiple customers
- **Examples:** Azure, AWS, Google Cloud

### **B. Private Cloud**
- Used exclusively by one organization
- On-prem or hosted

### **C. Hybrid Cloud**
- Mix of public + private
- Example: On-prem SQL Server + Azure Backup

### **D. Multi-Cloud**
- Using more than one cloud provider

---

## 4. Benefits of Cloud Computing
- **Cost Efficiency:** No upfront cost, pay-as-you-go
- **Scalability:** Automatically scale resources
- **Global Reach:** Deploy worldwide
- **High Availability:** SLAs + redundancy
- **Agility:** Rapid deployment
- **Security:** Strong compliance & protection
- **Innovation:** AI, ML, analytics

---

## 5. Shared Responsibility Model
Defines what the cloud provider manages and what the customer manages.

### **Responsibility Table**
| Responsibility | IaaS | PaaS | SaaS |
|----------------|------|------|------|
| Physical Infrastructure | Provider | Provider | Provider |
| Network & Datacenter | Provider | Provider | Provider |
| OS & Patching | Customer | Provider | Provider |
| Applications | Customer | Customer | Provider |
| Data & Access | Customer | Customer | Customer |

### **Key Notes:**
- IaaS → You manage more (OS, apps)
- PaaS → Focus on apps & data
- SaaS → Provider manages everything
