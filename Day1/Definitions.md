  
##  A) CLOUD FUNDAMENTALS   
### 1. Cloud Computing  
 Delivery of computing services (VMs, storage, databases, networking) over the internet.  
### 2. Region  
A geographic area where Azure has multiple data centers.  
### 3. Datacenter  
A physical building filled with servers and networking equipment.  
### 4. Availability Zone  
Physically separate data centers within a region — protects against datacenter failures.  
### 5. Region Pair  
Two Azure regions linked together for disaster recovery and automatic redundancy.  
### 6. Scalability  
Ability to increase or decrease resources based on demand.  
### 7. Elasticity  
Automatic scaling up or down based on workload needs.  
### 8. Agility  
Ability to quickly build, deploy, and manage resources without long delays.  
### 9. Vertical Scaling  
Adding more power (CPU/RAM) to an existing machine.  
### 10. Horizontal Scaling  
Adding more machines to handle more load.  **B) CORE AZURE STRUCTURE (Start With These)**  
**11. Resource**  
Anything you create in Azure — like a VM, storage account, network, or database.  
**12. Resource Group**  
A container that stores related Azure resources so you can manage them together.  
**13. Subscription**  
A billing and access boundary — all resource usage inside a subscription is billed together.  
**14. Management Group**  
A higher-level container that groups multiple subscriptions for centralized governance.  
**15. Azure Resource Manager (ARM)**  
The engine that creates, updates, and deletes Azure resources using templates, portal, CLI, or APIs.
